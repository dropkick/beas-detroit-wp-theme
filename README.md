## What's here?

`static/` is where you can keep your static front-end scripts, styles, or images. In other words, your Sass files, JS files, fonts, and SVGs would live here.

`templates/` contains all of your Twig templates. These pretty much correspond 1 to 1 with the PHP files that respond to the WordPress template hierarchy. At the end of each PHP template, you'll notice a `Timber::render()` function whose first parameter is the Twig file where that data (or `$context`) will be used. Just an FYI.

`bin/` and `tests/` ... basically don't worry about (or remove) these unless you know what they are and want to.


Development for this was done using [Local](https://getflywheel.com/design-and-wordpress-resources/toolbox/local-by-flywheel/) by Flywheel.

*Note: Previous versions of the site were developed using Fabrica Dev Kit running inside a Docker environment. So far, Local is a little more nimble and less problematic with relatively few hands in the project at a time.*
